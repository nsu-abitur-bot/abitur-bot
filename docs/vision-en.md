# Vision

## Project Topic and Description

A Telegram chatbot for NSU applicants.
The purpose of the bot is to provide consultations to applicants on admission and study-related questions at the university.
The chatbot will also help applicants track their position on the admission list.

## What Problem Are We Solving?

The process of entering a university is a complex and stressful stage in an applicant’s life.
Information about admission and studying at NSU is currently scattered across different sections of the website, so finding it requires time and persistence. Many applicants cannot find answers to their questions or are not even aware of the university’s opportunities — for example, scholarship programs, what life in the dormitory is like, or which documents need to be submitted.
In addition, tracking one’s position in the ranking lists becomes a routine process: the applicant has to open the website several times a day, find the right page, enter their SNILS, and manually check whether their position has changed.
This increases anxiety levels, worsens sleep, and overall makes this important stage of admission even more stressful.
If the situation does not change, the university risks losing potential students who either cannot access information about its advantages or simply get tired of the complicated admission process.

## What Scenario (Algorithm) Is Proposed to Solve the Problem With the Developed Software?

### Searching for Information on the Website

From a technological perspective, answering questions will be implemented using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) — an approach in which the bot first searches for relevant documents in the knowledge base and then generates a clear and accurate answer based on them.
Instead of the classic website search and navigating through different sections, the following scenario is proposed:

1. Open the Telegram bot.
2. Ask the question of interest.
3. Receive a ready-to-read answer in a convenient format.

### Tracking Position in the Ranking List

With our bot, there will be no need to open the website and check your position several times a day — you will simply:

1. Provide your SNILS in the bot.
2. Receive notifications about changes in the list.

## What Is the Expected Result of the Project?

A Telegram bot that will answer users’ questions about admission and studying at NSU and send them notifications when their position on the admission list changes.

## Key Features

1. Answering users’ questions about admission and studying at NSU.
2. Notifying users about changes in their position in the ranking list.
3. Increasing NSU’s attractiveness compared to other universities.
